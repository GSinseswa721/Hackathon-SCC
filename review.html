            <p>The coffee is really good and fair trade. The staff is nice and can tell a lot about the coffees they serve. The view is amazing and the decoration is beautiful!</p>

            <p>Nice coffee and staff. Explained about the different kind of coffees and you can try some. I tried the Americano, but they also have cappuccino, flavours like caramel or mocha and tea or choco latte.</p>

            <p>I was moved by the cafe that I happened to drop by during the trip.‚òïÔ∏è Flavoured coffee and friendly staff remain in memory!
                I drank coffee while traveling in many countries and I think coffee here is the best. The only thing I bummer is that it's far from my houseüòÖ</p>
